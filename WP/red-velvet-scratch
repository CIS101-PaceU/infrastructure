// To use a "custom template" (how we add can go to redvelvet.com/announcements):

1. Create the announcements.php file in the templates directory of your theme.
It needs to start with this comment for WP to recognize it:
<?php /* Template Name: announcements */ ?>

2. Go to the WP admin console, pages tab, and create an announcements page.
Your new template is available in the drop down.

3. The "permalink" has a stupid "index.php" in it. In the WP admin console, go to Settings->permalinks to change this.

4. Notice at the bottom of the page WP telling you to update the .htaccess file.
The .htaccess file should be in the WP directory. Create it if you don't have it.

5. Now you should be able to go to localhost/WP/announcements
